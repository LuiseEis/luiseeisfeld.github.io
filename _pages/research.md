## [Entry and Acquisitions in Software Markets](https://luiseeisfeld.github.io/assets/docs/JMP_Eisfeld_TSE.pdf) (Job Market Paper)

How do acquisitions of young, innovative, venture capital funded firms (startups) affect entry incentives of new firms? I create a new dataset by merging web-scraped product-level data on enterprise software with data on firms' entry and acquisition decisions. The data produce new facts on software acquisitions, showing that acquirers are heterogeneous and follow different strategies. I build and estimate a dynamic model that endogenizes startups’ entry decisions in the face of the acquisitions. In the model, acquisitions can affect returns to entry (1) via market structure, and (2) by providing an entry-for-buyout incentive to potential entrants. I find that, whereas overall startup acquisitions can incentivize new firms to enter, certain types of acquisitions -- those conducted by established industry players and targeting more mature startups -- seem to deter startup entry. Preliminary results from counterfactual simulations suggest that if competition authorities were to block all startup acquisitions, entry would fall. A case-by-case merger analysis may thus be favorable for sustained startup entry.

## [How do Online Product Rankings Influence Sellers’ Pricing Behavior?](https://luiseeisfeld.github.io/assets/docs/HotelRankings_Eisfeld_TSE.pdf)

Products that are displayed more prominently on e-commerce platforms are more likely to be found and purchased by consumers. The algorithms ranking these products, however, may condition a product's position in a listings page on its price. Using web-scraped data from hotels displayed on Expedia and an instrumental variable identification strategy, I find that the ranking algorithm tends to display hotels at _less_ favorable positions at times at which they are priced _higher_. I provide a framework that employs these estimates jointly with demand parameters obtained from a sequential search model. I simulate a counterfactual scenario, and reveal that Expedia's ranking algorithm tends to intensify price competition between sellers compared to a random ranking. This increases consumer welfare, but reduces seller profits. My finding has consequences for two-sided platforms' optimal design of ranking algorithms: in order to foster adoption, platforms should carefully trade off benefits arising to the two sides, and consider equilibrium effects.
