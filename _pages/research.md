## [Entry and Acquisitions in Software Markets](https://luiseeisfeld.github.io/assets/docs/JMP_Eisfeld_TSE.pdf) (Job Market Paper)

_**Schumpeter Prize**, Best Student Paper on Antitrust ([ITIF](https://itif.org/publications/2022/03/28/schumpeter-prize-best-student-paper-antitrust/)), 2022. **Finalist**, Lear Young Talent Competition Award, 2021._

How do acquisitions of young, innovative, venture capital funded firms (startups) affect the incentives of new firms to enter a market? I build a dynamic model that endogenizes startups’ entry decisions in the face of these acquisitions. In the model, acquisitions can affect returns to entry (1) via market structure, and (2) by providing an entry-for-buyout incentive to potential entrants. I estimate the model using a new, product-level dataset on enterprise software that I created. I find that, whereas startup acquisitions overall incentivize new firms to enter, certain types of acquisitions -- those conducted by established industry players and targeting more mature startups -- tend to be followed by less entry. Preliminary results from counterfactual simulations suggest that if competition authorities were to block all startup acquisitions, entry would fall in some markets. Thus, merger analysis should continue to proceed on a case-by-case basis in order to encourage sustained startup entry.

## [How do Online Product Rankings Influence Sellers’ Pricing Behavior?](https://luiseeisfeld.github.io/assets/docs/HotelRankings_Eisfeld_TSE.pdf)

Products that are displayed more prominently on e-commerce platforms are more likely to be found and purchased by consumers. The algorithms ranking these products, however, may condition a product's position in a listings page on its price. Using web-scraped data from hotels displayed on Expedia and an instrumental variable identification strategy, I find that the ranking algorithm tends to display hotels at _less_ favorable positions at times at which they are priced _higher_. I provide a framework that employs these estimates jointly with demand parameters obtained from a sequential search model. I simulate a counterfactual scenario, and reveal that Expedia's ranking algorithm tends to intensify price competition between sellers compared to a random ranking. This increases consumer welfare, but reduces seller profits. My finding has consequences for two-sided platforms' optimal design of ranking algorithms: in order to foster adoption, platforms should carefully trade off benefits arising to the two sides, and consider equilibrium effects.
