### [Entry and Acquisitions in Software Markets](https://luiseeisfeld.github.io/assets/docs/JMP_Eisfeld_TSE.pdf) (Job Market Paper)

How do acquisitions of young, innovative, venture capital funded firms (startups) affect entry incentives of new firms? I create a new dataset by merging web-scraped product-level data on enterprise software with data on firms' M&A activities. I find suggestive evidence that the effect of acquisitions on entry may depend on the type of the acquirer, and develop a structural model of startups’ entry decisions. In the model, acquisitions can affect returns to entry (1) via market structure, and (2) by providing an entry-for-buyout incentive to potential entrants. I find evidence of a negative market structure effect, and a positive entry-for-buyout effect. My preliminary evidence suggests that blocking all acquisitions would reduce entry.

### How do Online Product Rankings Influence Sellers’ Pricing Behavior?

Products that are displayed more prominently on e-commerce platforms are more likely to be found and purchased by consumers. A product’s default positioning, however, may depend on the seller’s pricing decision. By conditioning a product’s position on its price, ranking algorithms can thus intensify, or weaken the extent of price competition between sellers. Using scraped data from hotels displayed on Expedia, I find that for a given hotel, a lower price implies a more prominent position in the ranked list of results. I provide a structural framework that allows to simulate how changes in the ranking algorithm influence hotel and platform profits, consumer surplus, and welfare. To perform these counterfactual simulations, I employ my estimates jointly with demand parameters obtained from a sequential search model by Ursu (2018).
