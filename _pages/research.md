### Entry and Acquisitions in Software Markets

How do acquisitions of young, innovative, Venture Capital funded firms (startups) affect the entry of new firms? To answer this question, I collect product-level data on enterprise software and merge it with companies’ histories of acquisitions. I apply a machine learning algorithm to cluster products that are likely substitutable into markets, and provide novel stylized facts on startup acquisitions in software markets. In ongoing work, I develop a structural model of startups’ entry decisions and acquisitions. The goal is to simulate how entry would evolve if antitrust authorities were to prevent the acquisition of software startups.

### How do Online Product Rankings Influence Sellers’ Pricing Behavior?

Products that are displayed more prominently on e-commerce platforms are more likely to be found and purchased by consumers. A product’s default positioning, however, may depend on the seller’s pricing decision. By conditioning a product’s position on its price, ranking algorithms can thus intensify, or weaken the extent of price competition between sellers. Using scraped data from hotels displayed on Expedia, I find that for a given hotel, a lower price implies a more prominent position in the ranked list of results. I provide a structural framework that allows to simulate how changes in the ranking algorithm influence hotel and platform profits, consumer surplus, and welfare. To perform these counterfactual simulations, I employ my estimates jointly with demand parameters obtained from a sequential search model by Ursu (2018).
