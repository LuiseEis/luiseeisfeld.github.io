I am a [Ph.D. Candidate in Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu/people/luise-eisfeld) at the [Toulouse School of Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu). As of Spring 2022, I am a Visiting PhD Student at the [Technology and Policy Research Initiative (TPRI)](https://sites.bu.edu/tpri/) at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu).

My fields of research are **Empirical Industrial Organization**, the **Economics of Digitization**, and **Innovation**. I try to understand how digitization affects competition between firms, and ultimately market outcomes. I have a particular interest in the functioning of two-sided markets, and in the interlinkages between market structure and innovation in the digital technology sector.
