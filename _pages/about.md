I am a [Ph.D. Candidate in Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu/people/luise-eisfeld) at the [Toulouse School of Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu). 

As of Spring 2022, I am visiting the [Technology and Policy Research Initiative (TPRI)](https://sites.bu.edu/tpri/) at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu).

Research interests: 
* Primary: Empirical Industrial Organization; Economics of Digitization
* Secondary: Applied Microeconomics; Competition Policy

In my research, I try to understand how digitization affects competition between firms, and to measure the consequences for market outcomes and welfare. My most recent papers study entry and market dynamics in software industries, and the functioning of online marketplaces.
