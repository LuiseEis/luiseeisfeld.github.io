I am a [Ph.D. Candidate in Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu/people/luise-eisfeld) at the [Toulouse School of Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu). I am on the academic Job Market in 2022/2023.

**Research interests:**
* Primary: Empirical Industrial Organization; Economics of Digitization
* Secondary: Applied Microeconomics; Competition Policy

In my research, I broadly try to understand how digitization affects competition between firms, and ultimately market outcomes and welfare. 

Methodologically, I use both reduced-form techniques and structural econometric models of firm and consumer behavior. My most recent [papers](https://luiseeisfeld.github.io/research/) study entry and market dynamics in software industries, and the functioning of online marketplaces. Both papers use novel, web-scraped datasets.

In Spring 2022, I was visiting the [Technology and Policy Research Initiative (TPRI)](https://sites.bu.edu/tpri/) at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu).
