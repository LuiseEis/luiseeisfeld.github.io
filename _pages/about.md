I am an Assistant Professor of Finance at [HEC Lausanne](https://applicationspub.unil.ch/interpub/noauth/php/Un/UnUnite.php?UnId=23&LanCode=37&menu=equi). 

**Research interests:**
* Primary: Entrepreneurial Finance; Empirical Industrial Organization
* Secondary: Economics of Digitization; Innovation; Competition Policy

In my research, I study competition and innovation in the context of digital markets. More broadly, I am interested in the implications of digitization for market outcomes and welfare. 

Methodologically, I use both reduced-form analysis and structural econometric models of firm and consumer behavior. My most recent [papers](https://luiseeisfeld.github.io/research/) study entry and market dynamics in software industries, and the functioning of online marketplaces. Both papers use unique, web-scraped data.

I obtained my Ph.D. in Economics at the [Toulouse School of Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu) in 2023, and I spent six months at the [Technology and Policy Research Initiative](https://sites.bu.edu/tpri/) at Boston University in 2022. Prior to that, I completed a Master's Degree at the Toulouse School of Economics, and a Bachelor's Degree in Economics at the [University of Mannheim](https://www.vwl.uni-mannheim.de/en/).
