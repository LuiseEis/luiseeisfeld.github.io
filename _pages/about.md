I am an Assistant Professor of Finance at [HEC Lausanne](https://applicationspub.unil.ch/interpub/noauth/php/Un/UnUnite.php?UnId=23&LanCode=37&menu=equi). Prior to that, I obtained a Ph.D. in Economics at the [Toulouse School of Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu) in 2023.

**Research interests:**
* Primary: Entrepreneurial Finance; Empirical Industrial Organization
* Secondary: Economics of Digitization; Innovation; Competition Policy

In my research, I study competition and innovation in the context of digital markets. More broadly, I am interested in the implications of digitization for market outcomes and welfare. 

Methodologically, I use both reduced-form analysis and structural econometric models of firm and consumer behavior. My most recent [papers](https://luiseeisfeld.github.io/research/) study entry and market dynamics in software industries, and the functioning of online marketplaces. Both papers use unique, web-scraped data.
