I am a [Ph.D. Candidate in Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu/people/luise-eisfeld) at the [Toulouse School of Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu). 

As of Spring 2022, I am visiting the [Technology and Policy Research Initiative (TPRI)](https://sites.bu.edu/tpri/) at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu).

Research interests: **Empirical Industrial Organization** &#124; **Economics of Digitization** &#124; **Competition Policy**

I try to understand how digitization affects competition between firms, and ultimately market outcomes and welfare. In my ongoing research, I study market structure in software industries, and the functioning of online marketplaces.
