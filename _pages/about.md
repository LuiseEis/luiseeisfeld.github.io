I am a [Ph.D. Candidate in Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu/people/luise-eisfeld) at the [Toulouse School of Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu). 

I am interested in **Empirical Industrial Organization** and the **Economics of Digitization**. In my current research, I explore how digitization affects market structure and competition.
