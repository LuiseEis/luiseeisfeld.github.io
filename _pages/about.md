I am a [Ph.D. Candidate in Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu/people/luise-eisfeld) at the [Toulouse School of Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu). In August 2023, I am going to start a position as Assistant Professor in Finance at HEC Lausanne.

**Research interests:**
* Primary: Empirical Industrial Organization; Economics of Digitization
* Secondary: Applied Microeconomics; Competition Policy

In my research, I study competition and innovation in the context of digital markets. More broadly, I am interested in the implications of digitization for market outcomes and welfare. 

Methodologically, I use both reduced-form analysis and structural econometric models of firm and consumer behavior. My most recent [papers](https://luiseeisfeld.github.io/research/) study entry and market dynamics in software industries, and the functioning of online marketplaces. Both papers use unique, web-scraped data.
