I am a [Ph.D. Candidate in Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu/people/luise-eisfeld) at the [Toulouse School of Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu). In the Spring of 2022, I am going be a Visitng Student at the [Technology and Policy Research Initiative (TPRI)](https://sites.bu.edu/tpri/) at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu).

My fields of research are **Empirical Industrial Organization** and the **Economics of Digitization**, and I am interested in the economic and societal implications of digitization. In my current research, I explore the links between digitization and competition between firms.
